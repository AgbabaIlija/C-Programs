# C-Programs
Repository Description:

This repository contains several projects showcasing multithreading, Arduino programming, and a SA
community server:

1. Multithreading Projects:

 1.1 Matrix Animation: A multithreaded program that generates and displays random characters in multiple columns, simulating the "falling" Matrix effect with varying speeds and colors.
 
  1.2 Person Generator & Sorter: A multithreaded console application that generates 100 random people with names and ages, allowing users to interact with the list by pausing threads, displaying, and sorting by name.

2. Arduino Project:

 2.1 Sensor Data via MQTT: A C++ program for the Arduino platform that uses SPI, Ethernet, and MQTT protocols to send random sensor data (temperature, pressure, humidity) to an MQTT topic called "sensors."
  SAMP Community Server:

3. A basic server setup for the SA
 3.1 San Andreas Multiplayer community, including configurations and scripts for gameplay and player management.
